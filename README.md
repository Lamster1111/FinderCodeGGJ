## Background

I participated in the Global Game Jam at Humber from Friday, Jan 29 at 5:00 pm till Sunday, Jan 31, 5:00 pm. For those who don't know, a Game Jam is a challenge to make a game in only 48hr all the coding, art, music, and release in 48hr, with a specific theme.
The theme for this Jam was Lost and Found, so I decided to make a video game where you find missing items in a maze, and return them to the people(in-game) who lost them.
